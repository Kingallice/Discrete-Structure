Problem:

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

14 = 2 × 7
15 = 3 × 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

644 = 2² × 7 × 23
645 = 3 × 5 × 43
646 = 2 × 17 × 19.

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?

Solution:

A loop is ran whle the currunet number of concurrent integers is not 4. 
Within this loop we run code to find all factors of each number. 
These values are stored into an array. Each factor is then checked for whether it is  prime. 
If it is we increment a variable for the number of prime factors. 
This variable is then checked to see if it equals 4. If it does, we increment the concurrent integer variable.
After the loop if the variable is not equal to 4, the concurrent integer variable is reset and the process runs again.
This goes until four consective integer are found that have four distinct prime factors each.

    I made Space Invaders for the final. I used Unity and C#. I has many of the features that you would see in the regular game. The aliens drop bombs on the player, and the player must shoot the aliens to save Earth. However, there is no end. As the player goes higher into the rounds, they will recieve more points for each kill and more lives. When looking at how the aliens drop bombs there are only 3 bombs that can coexist, this was implemented because otherwise the aliens would randomly overwelm the player. The player moves by using buttons. When pressed a function is called that checks to see if the player is able to move in that direction, and if able they will move. Extra lives are calculated by checking the current round and awarding a life if the current score is higher than the (round-1)*10000. As more aliens die the speed of aliens increases.
    There were some features that I wanted to implement. One of these being motherships that could drop extra lives and other buff or grant score when destroyed. I was planning on adding multiple alien types, luckily this is fairly simple due to how much code is setup. I also wanted to use the aliens to implement procedural generation of rounds so that no play through was the same. You could be quite unlucky and get a fairly easy second round, or potentially a round that was quite difficult. I also would have liked to create a leaderboard. For sure at the game's current state it is far from marketable, especailly due to if being called Space Invaders, but as far I know there is no Space Invaders game that implements rounds that are procedurally generated and it could add a large change that would keep players coming back.
